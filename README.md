# What?
A practitioner's guide to up and running in AWS with a starter python serverless function.

# Why?
You are interested in using AWS, learn better by doing rather than sitting through hours of videos, and you'd like a simple repeatable pattern to get you started using serverless tech.

AWS offers plenty of free training, and it's great at explaining the overview of AWS offerings but it can be lengthy and not focused on getting you up and running.

Serverless/lambda in particular is a great place to start but tutorials often don't cover the shortcuts to good practices like least privilege, storing/using secrets, logging, etc.

# Modules
Here's what this kickstart covers:

 - [Open an AWS account (setup IAM user, MFA)](Open_an_Account.md)
 - Setup your [AWS command line environment](aws_cli.md)
 - Setup [serverless environment](serverless_setup.md)
 - [Create and deploy a simple serverless python cron job](serverless_python.md)
 - [Make serverless cron job useful](useful_python.md), running a [shodan.io](https://shodan.io) query
